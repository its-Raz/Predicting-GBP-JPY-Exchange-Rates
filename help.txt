Follow these steps to reproduce the entire process:

Step 1: Preprocessing the Data

Run the preprocessing.py file:
This script is responsible for transforming the raw dataset and unifying all the relevant data into a single DataFrame.
The preprocessing process involves:
Adding relevant features such as technical indicators or other derived variables that enhance the modelâ€™s learning capability.
Handling missing data, scaling features, and preparing the dataset for LSTM model training.
The script outputs the transformed_data.csv file, which contains the fully preprocessed data ready for model development and evaluation.

tep 2: LSTM Architecture Model Development

Open the notebook: LSTM Architecture Model Development and Optimization.ipynb.
This notebook will:
Train models using various LSTM architectures with different configurations.
Plot the train, validation, and test sets to visualize the data splits.
Predict and calculate key evaluation metrics: MSE (Mean Squared Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) for the train, validation, and test datasets.
Save trained models for each architecture and produce an Excel summary (models_summary.xlsx) containing performance metrics for all tested architectures.

Outputs from this step:
Trained models for each architecture.
A summary Excel file with evaluation metrics for each model configuration.

Step 3: Data Analysis and Comparison

Run the notebook: Data Analysis - Comparison Architectures.ipynb.
This notebook will:
Process the models_summary.xlsx file generated from Step 2.
Plot various bar charts comparing the architectures' performance based on evaluation metrics (e.g., MSE, RMSE, MAE).
Optional Visualization:
If you prefer more interactive visualizations, you can open the Power BI file to explore the comparisons with dynamic plots.

Step 4: Review the Generated Plots and Saved Models

Plots.zip: This folder contains all the plots generated during the process, including:
Test vs. Actual values
Validation vs. Actual values
Validation loss and Training loss

"Saved LSTM Model Architectures": This folder contains all the LSTM models that were trained and saved during the process. Each model corresponds to the different architectures tested.

By reviewing these files, you can analyze the performance of each architecture and visualize how well the models fit the data.
